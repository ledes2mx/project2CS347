        <h1>How I met requirements!</h1>
        <h4>I met the requrements set out by the assignment by...</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Not having a to-do list as my project.</li>
            <li>Using MySQL as my database, so that I didn't have to use MongoDB or NoSQL.</li>
            <li>Using an express based service to interact with the database.</li>
            <li>Having the endpoints appropriately named.</li>
            <li>Having the service send and recieve complex data as JSON.</li>
            <li>Supporting the full CRUD operation spectrum.</li>
            <li>Having the database only be accessable in the droplet, and blocking all ports except the ones needed.</li>
            <li>Running Nginx to allow encripted access to the web service.</li>
            <li>Supporting cross-origin resource sharing using middleware and an options wildcard endpoint.</li>
            <li>Running the web service with pm2 so it stays running.</li>
            <li>Having the service stored on Github and is shared.</li>
            <li>Having the database's creation and schema on the repository.</li>
            <li>Commiting and pushing steadily over the process.</li>
            <li>Having my service respond to https://project2.miguelcodessometimes.me:8443/report.html</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>These are the parameters for each thing</h4>
        <p>For the GET requests, you can either..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>request https://project2.miguelcodessometimes.me:8443/log</li>
            <li>request https://project2.miguelcodessometimes.me:8443/log/:day/:month/:year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Day is a number, month is a string, year is a number.</p>
        <p>For posting, you must have the day(a number), the month(a string), a year( a number), a temperatrue(as temp(a number)), and the weather(any text).</p>
        <p>For a patch request, you must do https://project2.miguelcodessometimes.me:8443/log/:id where :id is a number that is shown in the get request. You must have all the parameters above in the post to see the change.</p>
        <p>For the delete request, all you have to have to delete something is the id. So you would use https://project2.miguelcodessometimes.me:8443/log/:id to delete an entry.</p>
